# Super Market Billing System

Welcome to the Super Market Billing System, a C++ project dedicated to creating and managing bills for a supermarket. This system allows you to add items with their name, rate, and quantity to a bill and print the complete bill with totals for each item.

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Open the project in your IDE or text editor.
3. Locate the `const string FILE_PATH = "Bill.txt";` line in the code. Change the `FILE_PATH` to the desired path on your system where you want the bill to be saved.
